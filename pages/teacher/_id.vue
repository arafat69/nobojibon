          Bangladesh is an independent country but independent has not yet reached the poor and miserable people properly. They are losing in life battle again and again. I have seen lack of people and great suffering since I was a child. I thought I would first change my own situation to see how I can improve anotherâ€™s life. With great delight, I am sharing my feelings about Nobo Jibon that contains the synopsis of actions and achievements of the organization. Since inception in 1998, Nobo Jibon has been working solely for the socio-economic and education development of the poor, helpless and destitute, especially women and children. The organization is always very keen to take the effective ways of development closed to the vulnerable people making the process accessible and participatory and maintains the sustainability of the progress of its programs. Successes achieved are the results of concerted efforts of the members of the Executive Committee and the General Body inter alia. It is my privilege to extend sincere thanks and gratitude to them for their tireless help in making good decisions and policies for smooth functioning of the organization. For successful implementation of the programs/projects, staffs always play a pivotal rule in the organization. I am proud that Noho Jibon has been able to develop a strongly committed staff 'team who always put their utmost efforts in proper implementation of the programs/projects undertaken by the organization. I would like to thank them for their learn spine and dedication towards the organization. Finally, I hope Nobo Jibon would be able to play a comprehensive role in reaching the ultimate gel of ensuring education for all, poverty reduction and sustainable development in the time to come.   I convey my heartfelt thanks and best wishes to all   SHAHID KHAN Founder Nobojibon.
